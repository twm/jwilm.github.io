      <p><a href="https://github.com/valloric/YouCompleteMe">YouCompleteMe</a> now supports Rust auto-completion and GoTo. Rust semantic
analysis is provided by <a href="https://github.com/jwilm/racerd">racerd</a>, a JSON/HTTP server powered by <a href="https://github.com/phildawes/racer">racer</a>. YCM
with Rust provides a superior experience to current vim-racer, emacs-racer, and
other racer-based plugins.</p>

<h1 id="youcompleteme">YouCompleteMe</h1>

<p>For the uninitiated, <a href="https://github.com/valloric/YouCompleteMe">YouCompleteMe</a> is a fast, fuzzy, as-you-type
code-completion engine built originally for Vim. YCM runs on Mac, Linux, and
Windows and includes completion engines for C/C++, ObjC, Python, C#, Go,
TypeScript, JavaScript, and now Rust. YCM additionally provides an identifier
based completion engine to supplement semantic completers and provide
completions for languages without native support.</p>

<p>The YCM core, <a href="https://github.com/valloric/ycmd">ycmd</a>, exists <a href="https://val.markovic.io/articles/youcompleteme-as-a-server">as an independent project</a>;
clients for <a href="https://github.com/valloric/YouCompleteMe">Vim</a>, <a href="https://github.com/abingham/emacs-ycmd">Emacs</a>, and <a href="https://atom.io/packages/you-complete-me">Atom</a>
all share the same infrastructure. The complete list of known clients is found
in <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd#known-ycmd-clients">the ycmd README</a>. If a ycmd client does not exist for
<code>$EDITOR</code>, integrating with ycmd is as simple as integrating with a REST API.
The <a href="https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd/tree/master/examples">ycmd example client</a> shows how it&rsquo;s done.</p>

<h1 id="rust">Rust</h1>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://rust-lang.org">Rust</a> is a systems programming language that runs
blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Support for Rust is now available in YCM. The result is a powerful development
environment providing completions and GoTo in your favorite editor. Examples
below assume your editor is Vim. For other editors, please reference their YCM
client.</p>

<h2 id="completions">Completions</h2>

<p>Semantic completions in YCM are provided when a <em>semantic trigger</em>, <code>.</code>, or
<code>::</code>, is detected. In the provided example, you can see a completion menu
immediately appear after typing <code>std::</code>, <code>std::collections::</code>, and <code>Vec::</code>; no
hotkey was necessary. As you continue to type, YCM fuzzy-filters available
completions using your input to narrow the completion list.</p>

<h2 id="goto">GoTo</h2>

<p>The YCM Rust Completer provides the <code>GoTo</code> subcommand. <code>GoTo</code> attempts to find
where the identifier under the cursor is defined. If successful, a buffer is
opened for the file containing the definition, and the cursor is placed on the
definition.</p>

<p>The complete GoTo command in Vim is <code>:YcmCompleter GoTo</code>, and I highly recommend
mapping it to some hotkey. Example:</p>
<pre class="highlight viml"><code>nnoremap <span class="p">&lt;</span>Leader<span class="p">&gt;]</span> <span class="p">:</span>YcmCompleter GoTo<span class="p">&lt;</span>CR<span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre>

<h2 id="ycm-configuration-vim">YCM Configuration (Vim)</h2>

<p>Rust completions and GoTo from the current crate and its dependencies will be
available without any additional configuration. For completions in the standard
library, a single variable <code>g:ycm_rust_src_path</code> must be defined in your .vimrc.</p>
<pre class="highlight viml"><code><span class="c">" Naturally, this needs to be set to wherever your rust</span>
<span class="c">" source tree resides.</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="nv">g:ycm_rust_src_path</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s1">'/usr/local/rust/rustc-1.5.0/src'</span>
</code></pre>

<h1 id="differences-from-vim-racer-emacs-racer-and-others">Differences from vim-racer, emacs-racer, and others</h1>

<p>Since <code>racerd</code>, and subsequently YCM&rsquo;s Rust Completer are powered by <code>racer</code>,
the same code-completion and find-definition features are available. The
addition of YCM to this equation provides a <em>massive</em> quality-of-life
improvement over the existing plugins:</p>

<ul>
<li>No hotkey required for completions</li>
<li>Fuzzy search of available completions</li>
<li>Identifier-based completion engine to supplement rust completions</li>
<li>Performance: Completions are cached within YCM, and latency with racerd is
typically only a few ms once files are cached from disk. This is discussed
more in the racerd section following.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="racerd">racerd</h1>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jwilm/racerd">racerd</a> is suitable for providing completions and find-definition support for
<em>any</em> Rust IDE and is not constrained to YCM. It provides several benefits over
integrating racer via the command line or with the racer <code>daemon</code> flag.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Persistent file caching: When starting a new racer process for every
completion, or when running racer in daemon mode, the cache is thrown out
after each operation. Racerd keeps this cache between requests. This gives a
nice performance boost since files only need to be read from disk once.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for dirty buffers: <a href="https://github.com/jwilm/racerd/blob/master/docs/API.md">Racerd&rsquo;s JSON API</a> supports a <code>buffers</code> field -
a list of file paths (which need not exist) and associated contents which is
added to the racer cache before performing a query. This feature eliminates
the need for temporary files.</p></li>
<li><p>HTTP/JSON API: Very effective method for integrating a semantic completion
engine. Just about every language has a built-in or library for querying such
an API, and it is extremely performant on localhost (a few ms for completing
out of standard library). The process is long lived; there is no process
startup overhead for each query. Racerd also has <a href="https://github.com/jwilm/racerd/blob/master/docs/API.md">extensive API
documentation</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<h1 id="giving-thanks">Giving Thanks</h1>

<p>YouCompleteMe would not be the fantastic project it is, both technically and as
a positive open-source community, without the work of <a href="https://github.com/valloric">@Valloric</a> and the YCM
team <a href="https://github.com/micbou">@micbou</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oblitum">@oblitum</a>, <a href="https://github.com/vheon">@vheon</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/puremourning">@puremourning</a>. <a href="https://github.com/jwilm/racerd">racerd</a> and
YCM&rsquo;s Rust completer would not have been possible without <a href="https://github.com/phildawes">@phildawes</a>&rsquo;
fantastic <a href="https://github.com/phildawes/racer">racer</a> library. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/birkenfeld">@birkenfeld</a> for his assistance
implementing some changes in racer to make racerd possible. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/reem">@reem</a>
whom I pestered with far too many questions in #<em>iron</em>. Finally, thanks to the
YCM team for reading drafts of this post.</p>
